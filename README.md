# Assignment-SIC

The Assignment-SIC project integrates an ESP32-based IoT system with a Flask backend to efficiently collect, transmit, and store environmental sensor data. The ESP32 module, equipped with a DHT11 sensor, sends real-time temperature and humidity data to Ubidots for visualization and analysis. Meanwhile, a Flask-based API ensures seamless data logging in a MongoDB Atlas database, providing structured storage and easy retrieval. This project demonstrates an end-to-end IoT solution that enhances data accessibility, visualization, and cloud-based management, making it a scalable and practical approach for IoT applications.
