# Assignment-SIC
The Assignment-SIC project integrates an ESP32-based IoT system with a Flask backend to efficiently collect, transmit, and store environmental and motion sensor data. The ESP32 module, equipped with a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity measurements and a PIR sensor for motion detection, sends real-time data to Ubidots for visualization and analysis. Meanwhile, a Flask-based API ensures seamless data logging in a MongoDB Atlas database, providing structured storage and easy retrieval.
